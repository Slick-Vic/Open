Explanation of Both Subjects Treat this shit like physics
	
	One of my greatest fears My second purpose is to remedy the disparity between the Math and CS. I attempt to fill this gap by introducing concepts in a more conversational way while using the mathematics to visualize the networks in simpler abstractions. However, the presentation of the mathematical background is limited since it is extremely easy to get distracted by irrelevant parts of the theory. In exchange, I explain the connections of the subject in more detail. Moreover, I made a blog where I am happy to answer inquiries. I intentionally frame the mathematics as such because there's always a ``disproportionate" amount of it in CS, and I mean to make this as fluid of a literature I can.
	
	I hold back on naming "pre-requisites" for two reasons: the former being I was never one to care of the mathematical rigor in presentation. As for the latter, I find persons (especially those with some math-related trauma) will shy away from the subject. Don't worry about it! Struggling through a reading and having to constantly search-up information as well as work through problems is a great (and probably the fastest) way to pick up STEM subjects! Regardless, if you're not comfortable with either Differential Geometry, Differential Topology, or Algebraic Topology, I'm not going to lie (no pun intended), this will be a learning experience. In an academic setting, these are the subjects that come after Multivariate Calculus/Real Analysis.
